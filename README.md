# Reflight

> re-thinking flightjs

This library is an attempt to rethink FlightJS for an ES6 and modern browser world,
while taking lessons from newer libraries like React and type systems like TypeScript
and Flow.

It is intended to increase maintainability of large Flight codebases, as well as reduce
startup cost and memory usage.

It is not recommended for new projects -- look at an existing project with community support,
such as React, Polymer, Angular or Ember.
